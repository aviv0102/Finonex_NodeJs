# Nodejs Project - Aviv Shisman


### Usually, I would split this files into router.js, controller.js, and more, but I didn't want to overdo it this time.
### I would also put the db connection in a secret and connect to it in a different file
### Thanks in advance :)

### npm run server (be available to save and retrieve events)
### npm run client (send the events)
### npm run processor (save the file into db)
